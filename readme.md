- Programming requires a lot of organizing and storing data.
- Organizing data in real life is like making lists, much like real life
New Year's Resolutions:
1. Keep  a journal

2. Take a falconry class

3. Learn Kubernetes

- Arrays are how JavaScript makes lists
- Arrays can store any data type
- Each item has a numbered position 

**Creating an Array** 
- one way to create an array is to use an array literal
- An array literal creates an array by wrapping items in square brackets
- Arrays can store any data type
- We can have an array that holds the same data types

**Accessing Elements**
- Each element in an array has a numbered position known as its index
- We access individual items using an index
- Arrays in JavaScript are zero-indexed
- Starts from 0 rather than 1 

let cities ['New York', 'Beijing','Nairobi'];

- cities is an array that has 3 elements
- cities[0] will access the element at index 0 in the array  cities
- cities[0] will access index 0 in the array cities

**updating elements**
- You can access elements inside an array using an index
- After having access to an element in an array, its value can be updated
- let seasons = ['Winter', 'Spring', 'Summer', 'Fall'];
